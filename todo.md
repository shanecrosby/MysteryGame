## To do ##
- Fix audio playback issues; first file not playing, add 1second pause between files to prevent overlapping/interruption unless user clicks a new clue.
- Fix icicle generation so that they aren't regenerated each time a clue is hovered
- Disable clue once it has been collected so it can't be clicked more than once
- Add https://github.com/yomotsu/three-particle-fire to campfire
- Add texture to moon
- Make stars circles and twinkly
- Find 3D building asset and replace primitive house with snowy cottage
- Duplicate snow cone on trees so both segments have snow, or remove entirely and re-texture tree to simulate snow
- Add terrain heightmap/bumpmap so it isn't flat
