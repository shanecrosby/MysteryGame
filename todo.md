## To do ##
- Check triggers for audio playback. 
- - Ensure that Intro.mp3 is triggered only by clicking "Start Game" button.
- - Ensure that HowTo.mp3 is only triggered when NOT clicking on clues.
- - Link Intro.mp3 and Scene1Intro.mp3 so that they play sequentially, and only once each.
- Change tree snow cones to incorporate transparency with noise for non-uniform snow coverage of foliage
- Add Audio mute/unmute button to UI beside menu button
